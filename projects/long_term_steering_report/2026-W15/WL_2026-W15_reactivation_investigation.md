# Reactivation Investigation: WL 2026-W15

**Metric:** Reactivation Rate  
**Period:** 2026-W14 → 2026-W15  
**Observation:** 88.67% → 89.29% (+0.70%)  
**Volume:** 9,277 orders  
**Significance:** Not significant

## Executive Summary

**Overall:** Reactivation Rate improved slightly from 88.67% to 89.29% (+0.62 pp), a change that is not statistically significant with volume of 9,277 orders.

**Funnel Analysis:**

| Step | Check | Δ Conv | Result |
| ---- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| L0: 8-Week Trend | Rate within normal fluctuation range (85.07% - 89.29%) | +0.62 pp | ✅ |
| L1: Country Breakdown | No countries exceeded ±2.5% threshold | All stable | ✅ |
| L1: PaymentMethod | "Others" dropped -66.67%, Apple Pay +3.99% | Mixed signals | ⚠️ |
| Mix Shift Analysis | All countries show stable impact despite volume shifts | No significant mix effect | ✅ |

**Key Findings:**
- The +0.70% week-over-week change continues an upward trend from the W08 baseline of 85.07% to current 89.29%, showing gradual improvement over the 8-week period
- PaymentMethod "Others" shows a dramatic -66.67% drop, but with only 3 orders this is statistically irrelevant noise
- Apple Pay improved +3.99 pp (72.06% → 74.94%) on 794 orders, though still underperforms vs Credit Card (89.92%) and Paypal (93.27%)
- AO experienced -12.0% volume decline (15,776 → 13,883) while simultaneously improving rate by +2.17 pp, suggesting possible quality filtering effect
- All four countries (GN, ER, MR, AO) showed positive rate improvements ranging from +1.07% to +2.17%, indicating broad-based gains

**Action:** Monitor - The improvement is not statistically significant and falls within normal weekly fluctuation. Continue tracking Apple Pay performance as a potential optimization opportunity.
