**Metric:** Payment Checkout Approval Rate  
**Period:** 2026-W14 → 2026-W15  
**Observation:** 96.9% → 97.22% (+0.33%)  
**Volume:** 44,168 orders  
**Significance:** Not significant

## Executive Summary

**Overall:** Payment Checkout Approval Rate improved from 96.9% to 97.22% (+0.33pp) in W15, a change that is not statistically significant and reflects normal week-over-week variation within the 8-week historical range.

**Funnel Analysis:**

| Step | Check | Δ Conv | Result |
| ---- | ----- | ------ | ------ |
| L0: 8-Week Trend | Within historical range (96.88%-97.30%) | +0.33pp | ✅ |
| L1: Country Scan | 1 country exceeds ±2.5% threshold | TK +7.54pp | ⚠️ |
| L1: Dimension Scan | 1 payment method exceeds threshold | Others -4.35pp | ⚠️ |
| L2: TK Deep-Dive | Broad improvement across all methods | +5.4% to +12.1% | ✅ |
| Mix Shift | No significant volume migration | All Stable | ✅ |

**Key Findings:**
- TK showed significant improvement (+7.54pp), driven by reduced "Insufficient Funds" declines (-5.81pp), with applepay improving most dramatically (+12.10pp)
- Braintree provider in TK improved +10.60pp (85.27% → 94.31%), suggesting possible infrastructure or fraud rule improvements
- "Others" payment method declined -4.35pp globally but represents minimal volume (950 orders, ~2% of total)
- Overall metric remains stable within the 8-week band of 96.88%-97.30%, with current rate near the upper bound
- Volume decreased slightly from 39,914 to 44,168 orders (+10.7%), with TK volume increasing +9.6%

**Action:** Monitor — The improvement is not statistically significant and the positive movement in TK appears to be a recovery from elevated decline rates rather than an anomaly requiring investigation.
